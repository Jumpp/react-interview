<b>Tasks:</b>

1. Refactor this app with the following criterion:

-   Use only functional components
-   Give it a good architectural structure
-   Change the UI look to something better. You choose the style.

2. Write unittests to test 1 component well.

EDIT:
Notes from the fork author:
```
I decided against using an actual UI framework. I wanted the assignment to be
mostly my handwriting, and a framework always bring conventions and a style.

The only thing i added was the "react-time-ago" (totally unnecessarily), "shortid" and
a cdn stylesheet link for semantic UIs.
